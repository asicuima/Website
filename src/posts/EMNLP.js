                    <p className="text-muted">31st Dec 2024</p>

                    <p>I attended my first major NLP conference this year: EMNLP in Miami. I learned a lot, met a lot of cool people and Miami was lush! ‚òÄÔ∏èüèùÔ∏èü™©</p>
                    <p>I thought I would share some of my favourite papers I came across during the conference: some from the main conference and others from workshops and co-located things. Note: these are not necessarily the 'best' papers from the conference, simply ones I found fun and/or interesting by some arbitrary measure. I am easily swayed by pretty posters.</p>
                    <p>I've given a brief description of what each one was about but these were very much hasty notes I scribbled down.</p>
                    <p>I'll start with an&nbsp;<strong>honourable mention</strong>:</p>
